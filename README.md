# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This code was developed with the help of Dev Ed's Youtube tutorial. See the link below for more details:

At the end of the tutorial, I noticed that there was a problem with the hand animations. Namely, the code provided by the tutorial didn't make the hands return to closed fists before beginning the next round. The way that I solved this problem was by adding the code shown on lines 46 and 47 of the app.js file. Let me know if you have any comments!
