# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This code was developed with the help of Dev Ed's Youtube tutorial.

At the end of the tutorial, I noticed a problem related to the rock-paper-scissors animation. Namely, the tutorial didn't provide a way for the "hand" animation to return to it's original state (i.e. the closed fist). The way that I solved this problem was by adding the code shown on lines 46 and 47 of the app.js file. Let me know if you have any comments!
